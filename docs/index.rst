SLSNe
=====

**slsne** is a package designed to access the light curves and parameters of the Type-I Superluminous Supernovae (SLSNe)
sample published in `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/your_paper_id>`_, where we describe the methods used to create
the catalog. In this documentation, we provide a number of functions to access the catalog and work with the data.

For examples on how to access the data see the Tutorials menu.
